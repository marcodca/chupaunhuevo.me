## Acknowledgments

That something "te chupe un huevo", is an Argentinian slang for saying you don't care at all about that thing, the English equivalent would be to "not give a s#*%". This app is intended to be used as a platform for keeping the record of such things. It's build on react and gatsby, with styled-components and framer-motion taking care of the styling. Local storage is used for making some data persistent. Dark mode is implemented in a very straight forward way thanks to css custom properties. Sound effects added with Joshw Comeau neat hook ("https://joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/").
